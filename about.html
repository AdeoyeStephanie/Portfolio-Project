    What is Stephanie up to? <br>
    <br>
     Right now, i'm working on restructuring this portfolio, i don't really like how basic it is so one of my goals for this upcoming
     break is to rebuild this in a cleaner way using react.Js and some other javascript and CSS frameworks. Of course while working on
     the new version this one will still be up :)
     <br>
     I love expressing my creativity through content creation and thank fully i've been quite consistent with that, and i've been 
    loving it so far
